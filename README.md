#Oystercard

This is a repeat of the [oystercard-challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/oystercard) written in Python instead of the original Ruby. You can find my original Ruby solution [at this repo](https://github.com/michaellennox/oystercard).

I have aimed to solve this challenge in a test driven manner with automated tests using the pytest package.

##Installation Instructions

Clone the repository then change directory into it.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:michaellennox/oystercard-python.git
$ cd oystercard-python
```

Install and activate VirtualEnv

```
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Install required packages using pip and the requirements.txt file

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open the interpreter and import the application files

```python
$ python
>>>
```

Now you can use the oystercard system.
